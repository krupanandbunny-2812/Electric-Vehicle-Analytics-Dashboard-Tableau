1. Project Title / Headline
 Electric Vehicle Analytics: Adoption & Performance Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption, performance metrics, and regional trends—enabling data-driven insights into the growth of sustainable transportation across regions and vehicle categories.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Electric Vehicle Analytics Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive Tableau visualization that explores EV adoption patterns, performance characteristics, and geographic distribution.
It helps analysts, policymakers, and business stakeholders understand how electric vehicles are evolving across regions and categories to support strategic decision-making in the EV ecosystem.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

 Tableau – Primary platform for data visualization and dashboard development

 Calculated Fields – Used to derive KPIs and performance metrics

 Parameters & Filters – Enabled dynamic, user-driven analysis

 Geographic Mapping – Visualized EV adoption and trends across regions

 File Format – .twbx for development and .png for dashboard previews

4. Data Source
Source: Public Electric Vehicle datasets (government & open-source platforms)
The dataset includes electric vehicle records covering:

Vehicle categories and types

Adoption counts and trends

Performance-related attributes

Geographic information (state/region-level data)

The data is structured to support category-wise, time-based, and regional analysis of EV growth and performance.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
With the rapid growth of electric vehicles, stakeholders often struggle to:

Identify regions with high or low EV adoption

Compare performance across EV categories

Understand geographic and category-wise trends using raw tabular data

Answering questions such as:

Which regions are leading EV adoption?

How does adoption vary by vehicle category?

What patterns emerge across geography?

…requires an intuitive, interactive analytical tool.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a visual analytics solution that:

Enables exploration of EV adoption and performance across regions

Supports policy planning, market analysis, and infrastructure decisions

Transforms raw EV data into clear, actionable insights

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Key KPIs (Top Section)
Displays high-level metrics such as total EV count, number of regions covered, and category distribution.

Geographic EV Adoption Map
Interactive map showing EV distribution across regions, helping users quickly identify adoption hotspots and low-penetration areas.

Category-Wise Analysis (Bar / Donut Charts)
Compares EV adoption across different vehicle categories for market segmentation insights.

Trend Analysis Charts
Visualizes adoption or performance trends to understand growth patterns over time.

Parameter-Driven Filters
Allows users to dynamically switch between metrics, categories, or regions for personalized analysis.

• Business Impact & Insights

Policy & Planning: Governments can identify regions requiring charging infrastructure expansion

Market Strategy: Businesses can target high-growth regions and vehicle categories

Sustainability Analysis: Supports data-driven evaluation of EV adoption progress

Executive Decision-Making: Simplifies complex EV data into intuitive visuals for faster insights
